note: Run the Project file. 

This program displays a variety of skins for the ever classic Chrome dinosaur. Now he can
be Iron Man, Bugs Bunny, Darth Vader, Winnie the Pooh, Zero Suit Samus, and Barney the Dinosaur.
There is also a birthday mode in which the dino dons a hat (taken from the
10th anniversary version of the chrome dino in which he was given a hat). 
Other than that, he can do the classic run, jump, and die. 
This Project only shows the different modes of my dinosaur. It does not actually run a dino game.

Janee's work, from 10 June 2021.
